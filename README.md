## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Business Problem  

A manufacturing company faced challenges in **monitoring production performance, quality control, and delivery efficiency** across multiple departments.  
Despite high production volume, management struggled to:  

- Identify machines responsible for frequent product rejections.  
- Track employee-wise productivity and rejection trends.  
- Detect performance drops during specific months.  
- Maintain consistent on-time delivery performance.  
- Manage and visualize KPIs across different platforms effectively.  

This project aims to build an integrated set of dashboards to uncover bottlenecks and improve **operational visibility** using **Excel, Power BI, and Tableau**.  

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Goals of the Project  

To design and develop **three analytical dashboards** that transform raw manufacturing data into **interactive visual insights** for decision-making.  

### üéØ Objectives  
- Track total **manufactured, rejected, processed, and wastage quantities**.  
- Highlight **machine-wise** and **employee-wise** performance.  
- Detect **monthly production anomalies**.  
- Compare **department-wise efficiency and rejection trends**.  
- Evaluate **on-time delivery** metrics.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Dashboard Breakdown  

#### üü© **Excel Dashboard**  
**Purpose:** Provide a quick, data-centric summary of overall production performance.  
**Charts Used:**  
- **Bar Chart:** Department-wise Manufactured & Rejected Qty  
- **Line Chart:** Production vs Rejection trend over time  
- **Pie Chart:** Employee-wise rejection distribution  
- **Card Visuals:** Key KPIs (Total Qty, Wastage, Processed, Rejection %)  

**Why These Charts:**  
To make data easily comparable and highlight rejection spikes across employees and machines.  

**Key Findings:**  
- Total Production: **49.79M units**  
- Rejection Rate: **0.98%**  
- Machines MC027 & MC026 show higher rejection trends.  

---

#### üü¶ **Power BI Dashboard**  
**Purpose:** Deliver interactive analysis with drill-downs and dynamic filtering.  
**Charts Used:**  
- **Donut Chart:** Employee-wise rejections  
- **Clustered Column Chart:** Monthly Manufactured vs Rejected Qty  
- **Line Chart:** Month-over-Month (MoM) variance analysis  
- **Card Tiles:** Total Work Orders, Active Machines  

**Insights & Performance Gaps:**  
- Consistent overall performance but visible dips in **February & October**.  
- Rejection rates stable but certain machines require **preventive maintenance**.  
- Department comparison shows **Footwear** leads in production output.  

---

#### üü™ **Tableau Dashboard**  
**Purpose:** Present an intuitive, visually clean view for exploring rejections and productivity.  
**Charts Used:**  
- **Bubble Chart:** Department-wise rejection visualization  
- **Bar Graph:** Machine-wise rejection rates  
- **Dual-Axis Line Chart:** Production vs Rejection comparison  
- **KPI Cards:** Total Manufactured, Rejected, Processed, and Wastage  

**Why Tableau:**  
Allows seamless filtering, real-time updates, and visual storytelling for decision-makers.  

**Findings:**  
- Total Rejected Qty: **491.02K units**  
- Average Processed Qty: **6K units**  
- Delivery performance distributed equally across months.  

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Business Impact & Insights  

**Operational Efficiency:**  
- Maintained <1% rejection rate across all departments.  
- Identified top underperforming machines for maintenance scheduling.  

**Productivity Optimization:**  
- Recognized seasonal dips allowing proactive resource allocation.  
- Balanced employee performance verified across production lines.  

**Delivery & Quality:**  
- Current on-time delivery: **33%**, potential improvement to **50%+** with process alignment.  

**Strategic Outcomes:**  
- Enable management to make faster, data-driven decisions.  
- Enhanced production visibility and reduced quality variation.  
- Strong foundation for implementing **Lean Manufacturing** and **Six Sigma** initiatives.
